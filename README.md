The Project
Creating a timed JavaScript Quiz with multiple choice answers. The user will have a time limit and for every answer they get wrong time will be subtracted. There will be 10 questions the user will try to answer before time expires. There will also be a list of High Scores kept so users can compare their scores to their peers
